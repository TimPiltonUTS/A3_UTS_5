# A3_UTS_5
The above Repository includes Timothy Pilton's A3 Assessment task in the form of a TWS file.
This file was created through Tableau and merged through coding in Github and Python.
There were previous edits made in another GitHub repository, however, the data was unfortunately lost.
Throughout the visual dashboard, the dashboard explores statistics based on position during the 2021-22 NBA playoffs.
Through various forms of data visual methods, such as pie charts, graphs and decimal statistics, the visualisation aims to be simple yet effective in its message.
The process for me was extremely difficult in developing this project so please understand the simplicity, however, I truly believe the effort was put in.
Thanks for viewing!.
